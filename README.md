# Solana DEX Aggregator

A modern, efficient DEX aggregator built on Solana, featuring split routing optimization, adaptive priority fees, and a clean React-based user interface.

## Features

- ðŸ”„ Split Order Routing: Optimizes trades by splitting orders across multiple DEXs
- ðŸ’° Adaptive Priority Fees: Automatically adjusts fees based on network conditions
- ðŸ”Œ Multi-Wallet Support: Compatible with Phantom, Solflare, and Torus wallets
- âš¡ Gas Optimization: Includes compute budget optimization and transaction simulation
- ðŸ“Š Transaction Simulation: Pre-simulates transactions to ensure success
- ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI: Clean interface built with shadcn/ui components

## Dependencies

Main dependencies include:
- `@solana/web3.js`: Solana web3 utilities
- `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`: React hooks for Solana wallet integration
- `@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets`: Wallet adapters for various Solana wallets
- Next.js: React framework
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework
- shadcn/ui: UI component library

## Configuration

1. Environment Variables:
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=your_rpc_url_here
```

2. RPC Configuration:
The app defaults to Solana's mainnet-beta cluster. To use a different cluster, modify the `endpoint` in `src/app/page.tsx`:
```typescript
const endpoint = clusterApiUrl('mainnet-beta'); // or 'devnet', 'testnet'
```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

3. Connect your Solana wallet using the "Connect Wallet" button

4. Enter the following information:
   - Input token mint address
   - Output token mint address
   - Amount to swap

5. Click "Find Routes" to see available trading routes

6. Select a route and click "Swap" to execute the trade

## Advanced Features

### Split Routes
The DEX aggregator can split orders across multiple routes to optimize for:
- Better pricing
- Reduced slippage
- Lower impact on liquidity pools

### Priority Fees
The system automatically adjusts priority fees based on:
- Recent network conditions
- Transaction complexity
- Desired confirmation time

### Gas Optimization
Includes several gas optimization features:
- Compute budget management
- Transaction simulation
- Adaptive priority fees
